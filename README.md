This is a music player app inspired by the iPod Nano, my first portable music playing device.

I am building this using no framework with the goal of reinforcing my knowledge of JavaScript basics.

In the future I will rebuild this using a framework I have not yet decided to add more functionality, such as... 
    - the ability to play a song when provided a youtube or soundcloud link 
    - the ability to change the UI color or make it correspond to the album cover
